Flask Notes App
This is a project created with Flask to broaden my understanding of Flask in Python. It is a simple notes website created with Flask that allows users to log in, register, and log out. When a user logs in, they can add a note and delete a note that belongs to them.

Features
User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out.
Add Notes: Authenticated users can add notes.
Delete Notes: Users can delete their own notes.
